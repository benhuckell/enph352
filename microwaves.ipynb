    "$ \\eta $ is known as the intrinsic impedance of a medium. In this case, for free space we will denote the intrinsic impedance of free space as $ \\eta_0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this value is dependent on the **permittivity**, **permeability**, and **conductivity** of the medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets consider a uniform plane wave travelling in the y-direction. This means that the electric field will vary in the z-direction, and the magnetic field in the x-direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with our electric field differential equation (in 1D), in a lossless medium (free space).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 E_x}{\\partial y^2} + k^2E_x = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This has a solution\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E = E_0 e^{-jky} \\hat{z}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents a wave travelling with speed\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v_p = \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{\\omega}{k} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu \\epsilon}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, using Maxwell's equations, we can derive the magnetic field $H$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = \\frac{k}{\\omega \\mu} E_0 e^{-jky} \\hat{x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since $ \\eta = \\frac{E}{H} $, and $ k = \\omega \\sqrt{\\mu \\epsilon} $, we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\eta = \\frac{\\omega \\mu}{k} = \\frac{\\omega \\mu}{\\omega \\sqrt{\\mu \\epsilon}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\epsilon}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Free Space Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\epsilon_0 = 8.85 * 10^{-12} \\frac{F}{m}  \\hspace{1cm} \\mu_0 = 4\\pi * 10 ^{-7} \\frac{N}{A^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\eta_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_0}{\\epsilon_0}} = 377 \\Omega $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### How?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the conductivity $ \\sigma $ of free space is zero, $\\eta_0$  is simply determined by the ratio of the permeability of the medium to the permittivity of the medium, which will be constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electric Field Reflection Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "The reflection coefficient describes the proportion of a plane wave that is reflected by an impedance discontinuity. In our case, since $ \\eta_1 \\neq \\eta_2 $, there will be a discontinuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{\\eta_2 - \\eta_1}{\\eta_2 + \\eta_1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the proportion of the wave that is reflected/transmitted will be dependent on both the absolute values and difference between the intrinsic impedance of each medium/material.\n",
